Drax Arcade is a web app for playing games. Visitors can create accounts, play games, save their high scores, rate the games, and leave comments.

I created this project so that I'm more familiar with modern methods of making a CRUD (create, read, update, destroy) app.

Express: I like using this for routing with Node.js
Webpack: Good for bundling all my scripts into a single file
Babel: I've found ES6 (and beyond) features to be very helpful and convenient with JavaScript
React: Great for making web apps and working with the DOM.
PostgreSQL:
Bootstrap:
