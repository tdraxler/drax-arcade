Drax Arcade is a web app for playing games. Visitors can create accounts, play games, save their high scores, rate the games, and leave comments.

I created this project so that I'm more familiar with modern methods of making a CRUD (create, read, update, destroy) app.

Express: I like using this for routing with Node.js.
Webpack: Good for bundling all my scripts into a single file, among other things.
Babel: I've found ES6 (and beyond) features to be very helpful and convenient with JavaScript.
React: Great for making web apps and working with the DOM.
PostgreSQL: Using an ORM (Sequelize), I get a convenient way to interact with a relational database. The database stores the user account info, as well as info on games.
Bootstrap: Using react-bootstrap, the app already looks a little more stylish.
